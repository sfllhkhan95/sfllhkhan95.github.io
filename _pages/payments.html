<!-- Page Title and Description -->
<section>
  <p>
    As an alternate to Freelancing websites which might charge processing fees, I let clients pay me here directly for services which they have received from me. The client would be informed of the total invoice amount through our regular channel of communication, and then they can complete their payment here.<br>
    <br>
    I also accept payemnts via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/saifkhichi06" target="_blank">PayPal</a>.

    If necessary, and as agreed beforehand, I would release any pending deliverables once the payment has been processed. Clients are adviced to keep a copy of their payment confirmation until then.
