NUST Connect is a platform where the whole community of National University of Sciences and Technology can come together and interact with each other.

<br>
## Purpose
1. To connect the NUST community by bridging the distance-gap between people, especially people from different schools/departments.
2. To provide them a platform for sharing opportunities with each other.
3. To allow students to get help from their peers and teachers.

<br>
## How it Works
1. Users <b>request an account</b> by registering in the application.
2. Once approved, they can <b>sign in</b> to their accounts.
3. Everyone is connected with everyone else by default (i.e. you see posts from whole community in your <b>timeline</b>), unless they <b>unfollow</b> someone.

<br>
## Key Feature: Timeline
1. Updates from everyone (except people you unfollowed) appear in your timeline.
2. Updates are grouped under/filtered by three categories:
  - Public – Updates from everyone</li>
  - School – Updates from people of your own school, e.g. SEECS
  - Department – Updates from people of your own degree, e.g. BESE
4. You can only see posts which have you in their <b>target audience</b>.

<br>
## Key Feature: Target Audience
1. Who should see a status update you post?
2. You limit the target audience by using the visibility controls.
3. For each post, you select the target school, degree and batch.

<br>
## Additional Features
1. <b>Subscribe for notifications</b> for status updates by specific users.
2. Ask for help by posting a <b>help request</b> on a user’s profile page, which starts a new discussion thread. You control who can see this discussion thread.
3. Visit user profiles by:
  1. ... browsing an accounts directory, or
  2. ... searching for a user by name or CMS ID.
