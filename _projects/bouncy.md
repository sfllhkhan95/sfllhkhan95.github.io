If you are a 90's kid, then you would remember [Snow Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Bros.) in arcades, and the Nokia game [Bounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_(video_game_series)) everyone loved. <b>Have you ever wondered...</b> What if King Scortch had not turned Nick and Tom into snowmen? What if they were cute little bouncing balls instead?

Meet Bouncy! A platform game with a Snow Bros-like gameplay, with one little difference: Your player is a red, bouncing ball instead of a snowman.
