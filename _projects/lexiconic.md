Lexiconic is an English language dictionary, written in C++ with OpenGL for the GUI. This was a personal project for a Data Structure and Algorithms course. In addition to a fast-lookup dictionary containing over a 100,000+ words and their definitions, the application also includes a collection of mini brain games aiming to help build vocabulary or strengthen IQ.
