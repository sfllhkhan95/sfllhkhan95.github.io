vRead is mobile-first social network for book readers, where users can connect with their fellow bookaholics. It allows users to search for great books to read, track their own reading activity and see what their friends are reading.

This is a space where people can talk about what they read, get recommendations, manage your digital library, and exchange digital books with their friends.

## Key Features
1. Search books in an extensive catalogue.
2. Preview contents of a book.
3. Track your reading activity.
4. Write reviews for books you have read.
5. A personal library for your digital books.
6. Lend digital books to your friends

## Supported Platforms
This is a web application with a mobile-first interface.

<br>
## Programming Languages
The back-end is developed using PHP language with a MySQL database. The front-end uses HTML and JavaScript along with jQuery and Bootstrap frameworks.

<br>
## Updates
I am in the process of migrating the database to Firebase, and front-end to Google's Material Components and JavaScript. Laravel framework is used for the backend.
