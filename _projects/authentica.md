Authentica is a signature verification system which allows banks to verify signatures on bank checks. It employs the latest techniques in deep learning to train a model for signature verification. With only eight signatures, a customer can be registered in our system, and all their subsequent bank checks can be checked for authenticity of signatures using our flexible user interfaces.

## Key Features
Verify signatures on bank checks in three easy steps:
1. Scan a bank check with our mobile app or a scanning device connected to your PC
2. Provide the bank account number of the user to which this check belongs
3. Wait for the system to inform you about the authenticity of the check
