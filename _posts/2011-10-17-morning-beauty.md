Shining stars, gleaming moon \
All there, obscuring gloom

Brightening sky, rising sun \
Birds fly, animals run

Cool breeze, gentle wind \
Ruffled reed, and green bunches

Butterflies fluttering in garden \
Singing hymns of Lord, the One

Alas, o poor man, alas! \
Youâ€™re sleeping still in bunk

Abandoning morning beauty \
That is ready to stun
